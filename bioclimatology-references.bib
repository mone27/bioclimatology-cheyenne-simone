In this hypsometer, water is heated electrically, and its boiling temperature is measured with a thermocouple. Once the boiling temperature is known, pressure is determined via the water vapor saturation pressure curve.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}The pressure range required is 1050–10 {hPa}, that is, slightly more than two orders of magnitude. In order to achieve an accuracy of 0.05\% in pressure (0.5 {hPa} at 1000 {hPa}), boiling temperature must be measured to about 0.01 K. This formidable requirement calls for very accurate calibration procedures that are novel in thermocouple thermometry. However, once the thermocouple is calibrated, individual hypsometers utilizing thermocouples made of the same batch of material do not require calibration. For computing pressure from boiling temperature, the Goff-Gratch reference function is suggested; if approximations cannot be avoided, they must be specially selected. When using another liquid (e.g., fluorochlorohydrocarbons) in the hypsometer, the accuracy required for the temperature measurement would be reduced, however, water was chosen because it is environmentally harmless.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}Apart from the fact that the hypsometer does not require individual calibration, its advantage over other pressure sensors is the fact that a given uncertainty in boiling temperature leads to a practically constant relative pressure error {\textless}em{\textgreater}dp{\textless}/em{\textgreater}/{\textless}em{\textgreater}p{\textless}/em{\textgreater} over the entire pressure range. Consequently, heights computed for the hypsometer sondes are more accurate than those obtained from sondes employing other pressure sensors (e.g., aneroids), as was confirmed in an intercomparison. The hypsometer is operationally used in the {SRS} radiosonde by the Swiss Meteorological Institute; so far nearly 3500 successful flights have been made.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}/section{\textgreater}},

This companion book to Gordon Bonan's Ecological Climatology: Concepts and Applications, Third Edition, builds on the concepts introduced there, and provides the mathematical foundation upon which to develop and understand ecosystem models and their relevance for these Earth system models. The book bridges the disciplinary gap among land surface models developed by atmospheric scientists; biogeochemical models, dynamic global vegetation models, and ecosystem demography models developed by ecologists; and ecohydrology models developed by hydrologists. Review questions, supplemental code, and modeling projects are provided, to aid with understanding how the equations are used. The book is an invaluable guide to climate change and terrestrial ecosystem modeling for graduate students and researchers in climate change, climatology, ecology, hydrology, biogeochemistry, meteorology, environmental science, mathematical modeling, and environmental biophysics.},

Soil {CO}$_{\textrm{2}}$ efflux was measured with a portable chamber in a Finnish Scots pine forest for three years, with a fourth year for model evaluation. Plot averages for soil {CO}$_{\textrm{2}}$ efflux ranged from 0.04 to 0.90 g {CO}$_{\textrm{2}}$ m$^{\textrm{−2}}$ h$^{\textrm{−1}}$ during the snow-free period, i.e. May–October, and from 0.04 to 0.13 g {CO}$_{\textrm{2}}$ m$^{\textrm{−2}}$ h$^{\textrm{−1}}$ in winter. Soil temperature was a good predictor of soil {CO}$_{\textrm{2}}$ efflux. A quadratic model of ln-transformed efflux explained 76–82 \% of the variation over the snow-free period. {\textless}br{\textgreater}{\textless}/br{\textgreater} The results revealed an effect of season: at a given temperature of the organic layer, soil {CO}$_{\textrm{2}}$ efflux was higher later in the snow-free period (in August and September) than in spring and early summer (in May and June). Regression coefficients for temperature (approximations of a \textit{Q}$_{\textrm{10}}$ value) of month-specific models decreased with increasing average soil temperatures. Efflux in July, the month of peak photosynthesis, showed no clear response to temperature or moisture. Inclusion of a seasonality index, degree days, improved the accuracy of temperature response models to predict efflux for the fourth year of measurements, which was not used in building of regression models. During peak efflux from mid-July to late-August, efflux was underestimated with the models that included degree days as well as with the models that did not. The strong influence of the flux of photosynthates belowground and the importance of root respiration could explain the relative temperature insensitivity observed in July and together with seasonality of growth of root and root-associated mycorrhizal fungi could explain partial failure of models to predict magnitude of efflux in the peak season from mid-July to August. {\textless}br{\textgreater}{\textless}/br{\textgreater} The effect of moisture early in the season was confounded by simultaneous advancement of the growing season and increase in temperature. In a dry year, however, the effect of drought was evident as soil {CO}$_{\textrm{2}}$ efflux was some 30 \% smaller in September than in the previous wet year. Soil temperature was a good overall predictor of soil {CO}$_{\textrm{2}}$ efflux, possibly partly because its apparent effect was strengthened by many environmental factors and ecosystem processes that varied in concert with its variation. However, the consistent underestimation by the predictive models for the peak season corroborates recent findings concerning the importance of seasonal changes in carbon inputs to processes producing {CO}$_{\textrm{2}}$ in soil.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Microbial activity is affected by changes in the availability of soil moisture. We examined the relationship between microbial activity and water potential in a silt loam soil during four successive drying and rewetting cycles. Microbial activity was inferred from the rate of {CO}2 accumulating in a sealed flask containing the soil sample and the {CO}2 respired was measured using gas chromatography. Thermocouple hygrometry was used to monitor the water potential by burying a thermocouple in the soil sample in the flask. Initial treatment by drying on pressure plates brought samples of the test soil to six different water potentials in the range -0.005 to -1.5MPa. Water potential and soil respiration were simultaneously measured while these six soil samples slowly dried by evaporation and were remoistened four times. The results were consistent with a log-linear relationship between water potential and microbial activity as long as activity was not limited by substrate availability. This relationship appeared to hold for the range of water potentials from −0.01 to −8.5 {MPa}. Even at −0.01 {MPa} (wet soil) a decrease in water potential from −0.01 to −0.02 {MPa} caused a 10\% decrease in microbial activity. Rewetting the soil caused a large and rapid increase in the respiration rate. There was up to a 40-fold increase in microbial activity for a short period when the change in water potential following rewetting was greater than 5 {MPa}. Differences in microbial activity between the wetter and drier soil treatments following rewetting to the original water potentials are discussed in terms of the availability of energy substrate.},

	abstract = {Soil respiration ({SR}) was measured with an infrared gas analyzer in nine plots representative of the heterogeneous vegetation in a mixed coniferous–deciduous forest in the Belgian Campine region. Selected plots included the two most representative overstory species (Pinus sylvestris L. and Quercus robur L.) in combination with the most representative understory species of the forest. A model that includes temperature and water as the main controlling variables was fitted to the data. We found large spatial variability in {SR} among plots, with typically lower fluxes under the coniferous overstory than under the deciduous overstory (means of 4.8 ± 0.4 and 8.8 ± 0.5 Mg C ha−1 year−1, respectively). Total annual soil carbon (C) emissions were estimated by weighting fluxes from different types of vegetation according to their relative contribution to the footprint area of the eddy covariance flux measurement. The relative contribution of the two main tree species to the footprint-weighted total {SR} varied among seasons with the more abundant coniferous overstory contributing the most to total {SR} during most of the year. Nonetheless, during summer, the contribution of deciduous plots to total {SR} was disproportionally high because of the more pronounced seasonality of belowground metabolic activity. Net ecosystem carbon dioxide exchange was measured by eddy covariance, and we estimated total ecosystem respiration ({TER}) with footprint-constrained nighttime fluxes. Mean total annual {SR} and {TER} were 6.1 ± 0.11 and 9.1 ± 1.15 Mg C ha−1 year−1, respectively. The 95\% confidence interval of the ratio of annual {SR}:{TER} ranged from 0.58 to 0.76, with a mean of 0.67. The contribution of {SR} to {TER} tended to vary seasonally, with minimum contributions during summer (less than 50\% of {TER}) and maximum contributions during winter (about 94\% of {TER}).},

	abstract = {1. From previously published measurements of soil respiration rate (R) and temperature (T) the goodness of fit of various R vs T relationships was evaluated. 2. Exponential (Q10) and conventional Arrhenius relationships between T and R cannot provide an unbiased estimate of respiration rate. Nor is a simple linear relationship appropriate. 3. The relationship between R and T can, however, be accurately represented by an Arrhenius type equation where the effective activation energy for respiration varies inversely with temperature. An empirical equation is presented which yields an unbiased estimator of respiration rates over a wide range of temperatures. 4. When combined with seasonal estimates of Gross Primary Productivity ({GPP}) the empirical relationship derived provides representative estimates of the seasonal cycle of net ecosystem productivity and its effects on atmospheric {CO}2. The predicted seasonal cycle of net ecosystem productivity is very sensitive to the assumed respiration vs temperature relationship. 5. For biomes in areas where soil temperatures are low, soil respiration rate is relatively more sensitive to fluctuations in temperature. Nevertheless, more information is required before any predictions can be made about changes in soil carbon pools in response to future temperature changes.},

We used 240 individual flux measurements of these three {GHGs} from different soil types, at three topographical positions and in two extreme hydric conditions in the tropical forests of the Guiana Shield (French Guiana, South America) to (1) test the effect of topographical positions on {GHG} fluxes and (2) identify the soil characteristics driving flux variation in these nutrient-poor tropical soils. Surprisingly, none of the three {GHG} flux rates differed with topographical position. {CO}2 effluxes covaried with soil {pH}, soil water content ({SWC}), available nitrogen and total phosphorus. The {CH}4 fluxes were best explained by variation in {SWC}, with soils acting as a sink under drier conditions and as a source under wetter conditions. Unexpectedly, our study areas were generally sinks for N2O and N2O fluxes were partly explained by total phosphorus and available nitrogen concentrations. This first study describing the spatial variation of soil fluxes of the three main {GHGs} measured simultaneously in forests of the Guiana Shield lays the foundation for specific studies of the processes underlying the observed patterns.},
