In this hypsometer, water is heated electrically, and its boiling temperature is measured with a thermocouple. Once the boiling temperature is known, pressure is determined via the water vapor saturation pressure curve.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}The pressure range required is 1050–10 {hPa}, that is, slightly more than two orders of magnitude. In order to achieve an accuracy of 0.05\% in pressure (0.5 {hPa} at 1000 {hPa}), boiling temperature must be measured to about 0.01 K. This formidable requirement calls for very accurate calibration procedures that are novel in thermocouple thermometry. However, once the thermocouple is calibrated, individual hypsometers utilizing thermocouples made of the same batch of material do not require calibration. For computing pressure from boiling temperature, the Goff-Gratch reference function is suggested; if approximations cannot be avoided, they must be specially selected. When using another liquid (e.g., fluorochlorohydrocarbons) in the hypsometer, the accuracy required for the temperature measurement would be reduced, however, water was chosen because it is environmentally harmless.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}Apart from the fact that the hypsometer does not require individual calibration, its advantage over other pressure sensors is the fact that a given uncertainty in boiling temperature leads to a practically constant relative pressure error {\textless}em{\textgreater}dp{\textless}/em{\textgreater}/{\textless}em{\textgreater}p{\textless}/em{\textgreater} over the entire pressure range. Consequently, heights computed for the hypsometer sondes are more accurate than those obtained from sondes employing other pressure sensors (e.g., aneroids), as was confirmed in an intercomparison. The hypsometer is operationally used in the {SRS} radiosonde by the Swiss Meteorological Institute; so far nearly 3500 successful flights have been made.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}/section{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Climate models have evolved into Earth system models with representation of the physics, chemistry, and biology of terrestrial ecosystems. This companion book to Gordon Bonan's Ecological Climatology: Concepts and Applications, Third Edition, builds on the concepts introduced there, and provides the mathematical foundation upon which to develop and understand ecosystem models and their relevance for these Earth system models. The book bridges the disciplinary gap among land surface models developed by atmospheric scientists; biogeochemical models, dynamic global vegetation models, and ecosystem demography models developed by ecologists; and ecohydrology models developed by hydrologists. Review questions, supplemental code, and modeling projects are provided, to aid with understanding how the equations are used. The book is an invaluable guide to climate change and terrestrial ecosystem modeling for graduate students and researchers in climate change, climatology, ecology, hydrology, biogeochemistry, meteorology, environmental science, mathematical modeling, and environmental biophysics.},
