In this hypsometer, water is heated electrically, and its boiling temperature is measured with a thermocouple. Once the boiling temperature is known, pressure is determined via the water vapor saturation pressure curve.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}The pressure range required is 1050–10 {hPa}, that is, slightly more than two orders of magnitude. In order to achieve an accuracy of 0.05\% in pressure (0.5 {hPa} at 1000 {hPa}), boiling temperature must be measured to about 0.01 K. This formidable requirement calls for very accurate calibration procedures that are novel in thermocouple thermometry. However, once the thermocouple is calibrated, individual hypsometers utilizing thermocouples made of the same batch of material do not require calibration. For computing pressure from boiling temperature, the Goff-Gratch reference function is suggested; if approximations cannot be avoided, they must be specially selected. When using another liquid (e.g., fluorochlorohydrocarbons) in the hypsometer, the accuracy required for the temperature measurement would be reduced, however, water was chosen because it is environmentally harmless.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}Apart from the fact that the hypsometer does not require individual calibration, its advantage over other pressure sensors is the fact that a given uncertainty in boiling temperature leads to a practically constant relative pressure error {\textless}em{\textgreater}dp{\textless}/em{\textgreater}/{\textless}em{\textgreater}p{\textless}/em{\textgreater} over the entire pressure range. Consequently, heights computed for the hypsometer sondes are more accurate than those obtained from sondes employing other pressure sensors (e.g., aneroids), as was confirmed in an intercomparison. The hypsometer is operationally used in the {SRS} radiosonde by the Swiss Meteorological Institute; so far nearly 3500 successful flights have been made.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}/section{\textgreater}},

Soil {CO}$_{\textrm{2}}$ efflux was measured with a portable chamber in a Finnish Scots pine forest for three years, with a fourth year for model evaluation. Plot averages for soil {CO}$_{\textrm{2}}$ efflux ranged from 0.04 to 0.90 g {CO}$_{\textrm{2}}$ m$^{\textrm{−2}}$ h$^{\textrm{−1}}$ during the snow-free period, i.e. May–October, and from 0.04 to 0.13 g {CO}$_{\textrm{2}}$ m$^{\textrm{−2}}$ h$^{\textrm{−1}}$ in winter. Soil temperature was a good predictor of soil {CO}$_{\textrm{2}}$ efflux. A quadratic model of ln-transformed efflux explained 76–82 \% of the variation over the snow-free period. {\textless}br{\textgreater}{\textless}/br{\textgreater} The results revealed an effect of season: at a given temperature of the organic layer, soil {CO}$_{\textrm{2}}$ efflux was higher later in the snow-free period (in August and September) than in spring and early summer (in May and June). Regression coefficients for temperature (approximations of a \textit{Q}$_{\textrm{10}}$ value) of month-specific models decreased with increasing average soil temperatures. Efflux in July, the month of peak photosynthesis, showed no clear response to temperature or moisture. Inclusion of a seasonality index, degree days, improved the accuracy of temperature response models to predict efflux for the fourth year of measurements, which was not used in building of regression models. During peak efflux from mid-July to late-August, efflux was underestimated with the models that included degree days as well as with the models that did not. The strong influence of the flux of photosynthates belowground and the importance of root respiration could explain the relative temperature insensitivity observed in July and together with seasonality of growth of root and root-associated mycorrhizal fungi could explain partial failure of models to predict magnitude of efflux in the peak season from mid-July to August. {\textless}br{\textgreater}{\textless}/br{\textgreater} The effect of moisture early in the season was confounded by simultaneous advancement of the growing season and increase in temperature. In a dry year, however, the effect of drought was evident as soil {CO}$_{\textrm{2}}$ efflux was some 30 \% smaller in September than in the previous wet year. Soil temperature was a good overall predictor of soil {CO}$_{\textrm{2}}$ efflux, possibly partly because its apparent effect was strengthened by many environmental factors and ecosystem processes that varied in concert with its variation. However, the consistent underestimation by the predictive models for the peak season corroborates recent findings concerning the importance of seasonal changes in carbon inputs to processes producing {CO}$_{\textrm{2}}$ in soil.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Microbial activity is affected by changes in the availability of soil moisture. We examined the relationship between microbial activity and water potential in a silt loam soil during four successive drying and rewetting cycles. Microbial activity was inferred from the rate of {CO}2 accumulating in a sealed flask containing the soil sample and the {CO}2 respired was measured using gas chromatography. Thermocouple hygrometry was used to monitor the water potential by burying a thermocouple in the soil sample in the flask. Initial treatment by drying on pressure plates brought samples of the test soil to six different water potentials in the range -0.005 to -1.5MPa. Water potential and soil respiration were simultaneously measured while these six soil samples slowly dried by evaporation and were remoistened four times. The results were consistent with a log-linear relationship between water potential and microbial activity as long as activity was not limited by substrate availability. This relationship appeared to hold for the range of water potentials from −0.01 to −8.5 {MPa}. Even at −0.01 {MPa} (wet soil) a decrease in water potential from −0.01 to −0.02 {MPa} caused a 10\% decrease in microbial activity. Rewetting the soil caused a large and rapid increase in the respiration rate. There was up to a 40-fold increase in microbial activity for a short period when the change in water potential following rewetting was greater than 5 {MPa}. Differences in microbial activity between the wetter and drier soil treatments following rewetting to the original water potentials are discussed in terms of the availability of energy substrate.},

	abstract = {Soil respiration ({SR}) was measured with an infrared gas analyzer in nine plots representative of the heterogeneous vegetation in a mixed coniferous–deciduous forest in the Belgian Campine region. Selected plots included the two most representative overstory species (Pinus sylvestris L. and Quercus robur L.) in combination with the most representative understory species of the forest. A model that includes temperature and water as the main controlling variables was fitted to the data. We found large spatial variability in {SR} among plots, with typically lower fluxes under the coniferous overstory than under the deciduous overstory (means of 4.8 ± 0.4 and 8.8 ± 0.5 Mg C ha−1 year−1, respectively). Total annual soil carbon (C) emissions were estimated by weighting fluxes from different types of vegetation according to their relative contribution to the footprint area of the eddy covariance flux measurement. The relative contribution of the two main tree species to the footprint-weighted total {SR} varied among seasons with the more abundant coniferous overstory contributing the most to total {SR} during most of the year. Nonetheless, during summer, the contribution of deciduous plots to total {SR} was disproportionally high because of the more pronounced seasonality of belowground metabolic activity. Net ecosystem carbon dioxide exchange was measured by eddy covariance, and we estimated total ecosystem respiration ({TER}) with footprint-constrained nighttime fluxes. Mean total annual {SR} and {TER} were 6.1 ± 0.11 and 9.1 ± 1.15 Mg C ha−1 year−1, respectively. The 95\% confidence interval of the ratio of annual {SR}:{TER} ranged from 0.58 to 0.76, with a mean of 0.67. The contribution of {SR} to {TER} tended to vary seasonally, with minimum contributions during summer (less than 50\% of {TER}) and maximum contributions during winter (about 94\% of {TER}).},

	abstract = {1. From previously published measurements of soil respiration rate (R) and temperature (T) the goodness of fit of various R vs T relationships was evaluated. 2. Exponential (Q10) and conventional Arrhenius relationships between T and R cannot provide an unbiased estimate of respiration rate. Nor is a simple linear relationship appropriate. 3. The relationship between R and T can, however, be accurately represented by an Arrhenius type equation where the effective activation energy for respiration varies inversely with temperature. An empirical equation is presented which yields an unbiased estimator of respiration rates over a wide range of temperatures. 4. When combined with seasonal estimates of Gross Primary Productivity ({GPP}) the empirical relationship derived provides representative estimates of the seasonal cycle of net ecosystem productivity and its effects on atmospheric {CO}2. The predicted seasonal cycle of net ecosystem productivity is very sensitive to the assumed respiration vs temperature relationship. 5. For biomes in areas where soil temperatures are low, soil respiration rate is relatively more sensitive to fluctuations in temperature. Nevertheless, more information is required before any predictions can be made about changes in soil carbon pools in response to future temperature changes.},

Surprisingly, none of the three {GHG} flux rates differed with topographical position. {CO}2 effluxes covaried with soil {pH}, soil water content ({SWC}), available nitrogen and total phosphorus. The {CH}4 fluxes were best explained by variation in {SWC}, with soils acting as a sink under drier conditions and as a source under wetter conditions. Unexpectedly, our study areas were generally sinks for N2O and N2O fluxes were partly explained by total phosphorus and available nitrogen concentrations.

The aims were to: (1) quantify the detection limit and random uncertainty of turbulent fluxes, (2) assess the systematic error caused by {EC} calculation-procedure choices on the energy balance residual and (3) report the energy balance of the world's northernmost urban flux station. The mean detection limits were about 10\% of the observed flux, and the random uncertainty was 9–16\%. Of all fluxes, the latent heat flux – as measured with a closed-path gas analyser – was most prone to systematic calculation errors due to water vapour interactions with tube walls: using a lag window that is too small can cause a 15\% lack of data (due to the dependency of lag time on relative humidity) and omitting spectral corrections can cause on average a 26\% underestimation of the flux. The systematic errors in {EC} calculation propagate into the energy balance residual and can be larger than the residual itself: for example, omitting spectral corrections overestimates the residual by 13\% or 18\% on average, depending on the analyser.},

The chapter then provides us with the theory and moves on to discuss the eddy covariance system and its sonic anemometer, temperature fluctuation measurements, infrared gas analyser, air transport system, and tower instrumentation. Additional measurements are also given in the chapter. Data acquisition and its computation and correction is discussed next in the chapter by giving its general procedure, half-hourly means (co-)variances and uncorrected fluxes, intercomparison of software, and correction for frequency response losses. The chapter has also discussed about quality control and four criteria are investigated here for the same. Spatial representativeness of measured fluxes and summation procedure are reviewed. The chapter then moves on to the discussion of data gap filling through interpolation and parameterization and neural networks. Corrections to night-time data and error estimation are also explored in the chapter. Finally, the chapter closes with conclusions.},

	abstract = {The natural greenhouse effect of the Earth is strongly influenced by the radiative effects of water vapour and clouds in the atmosphere, which control the energy absorbed from the sun, and that lost through thermal emission to space. Any perturbations to the climate balance, for example through so-called ‘radiative forcing’ due to increasing {CO}2 amounts, variations in solar constant, or other causes, can be amplified by the feedback processes that involve water in its various phases. The radiative cooling of the Earth in the absence of clouds has recently been shown to be dominated by emission from upper-tropospheric water vapour, in the far infrared portion of the spectrum, and this is illustrated: observations of this radiative flux, and of the distribution of water vapour in the upper troposphere, are urgently needed. The role of clouds is discussed, and it is noted that their response to global warming is not presently unambiguously determined with available models, due to the complexity of competing processes: again, as in the cloud-free case, more accurate global observations are needed. The paper is illustrated by data from satellite experiments, most notably the Earth Radiation Budget Experiment sponsored by {NASA}.},

	abstract = {Dark objects left out in the sun get warm. Lighter-colored objects, not so much. On a planetary scale, this simple, familiar phenomenon—associated with a characteristic called albedo—drives weather and climate. On a regional scale, it can influence the melting of sea ice and glaciers.



Open ocean and ice exhibit a big disparity in albedo. Sea ice covered with fresh snow reflects roughly 85\% of the sunlight that falls on it, whereas open Arctic waters reflect only about 7\%. Image credit: Shutterstock/Maxim Tupikov.



And yet, as with many factors influencing climate, albedo’s effects are complicated. Changes in Earth’s overall albedo, for example, influence the planet’s average temperature, which in turn affects the amount of water vapor the atmosphere can hold, which in turn affects our planet’s cloudiness—which in turn affects the planet’s albedo, starting the cycle anew. Because researchers often have difficulty determining how strong such feedbacks are, it’s hard to incorporate them in climate models.

But this seemingly simple concept extends beyond scrutiny of Earth to the study of other heavenly bodies. For decades, albedo has helped astronomers assess our planet’s risk of damage from rogue asteroids by offering a means of estimating their sizes. In the future, albedo could even help astronomers identify exoplanets that are possibly hospitable to life, as changes in albedo could indicate changing cloud cover, weather, and large amounts of liquid—possibly even seas—on their surfaces. Understanding darkness and light has a broad spectrum of implications.

The word albedo derives from an ancient language (in Latin, albus means white ), but the term’s use in science has a relatively modern origin: It first appeared in a 1760 treatise on optics by Swiss polymath Johann Heinrich Lambert. Since then, the term has become especially useful in astronomy, planetary science, and climatology. In the strictest sense, albedo—or whiteness —is …},

One group of estimates synthesizes global cloud, aerosol, and other information in a radiation model that is used to calculate fluxes. Because these synthesis fluxes have been assessed against observations, the global-mean values of these fluxes are deemed to be the most credible of the four different categories reviewed. The global, annual mean {DLR} lies between approximately 344 and 350 W m$^{\textrm{−2}}$ with an error of approximately ±10 W m$^{\textrm{−2}}$ that arises mostly from the uncertainty in atmospheric state that governs the estimation of the clear-sky emission. The authors conclude that the {DLR} derived from global climate models are biased low by approximately 10 W m$^{\textrm{−2}}$ and even larger differences are found with respect to reanalysis climate data. The {DLR} inferred from a surface energy balance closure is also substantially smaller that the range found from synthesis products suggesting that current depictions of surface energy balance also require revision. The effect of clouds on the {DLR}, largely facilitated by the new cloud base information from the {\textless}em{\textgreater}{CloudSat}{\textless}/em{\textgreater} radar, is estimated to lie in the range from 24 to 34 W m$^{\textrm{−2}}$ for the global cloud radiative effect (all-sky minus clear-sky {DLR}). This effect is strongly modulated by the underlying water vapor that gives rise to a maximum sensitivity of the {DLR} to cloud occurring in the colder drier regions of the planet. The bottom of atmosphere ({BOA}) cloud effect directly contrast the effect of clouds on the top of atmosphere ({TOA}) fluxes that is maximum in regions of deepest and coldest clouds in the moist tropics.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}/section{\textgreater}},

In general, the environments are arid and semi-arid with summers characterised by high temperatures and small precipitation. Due to the scarcity of water resources, the correct evaluation of water losses by the crops as evapotranspiration ({ET}) is very important in these regions. In this paper, we initially present the most known {ET} measurement methods classified according to the used approach: hydrological, micrometeorological and plant physiological. In the following, we describe the methods to estimate {ET}, distinguishing the methods based on analytical approaches from the methods based on empirical approaches. Ten methods are reviewed: soil water balance, weighing lysimeter, energy balance/Bowen ratio, aerodynamic method, eddy covariance, sap flow method, chambers system, Penman–Monteith model, crop coefficient approach and soil water balance modelling approach. In the presentation of each method, we have recalled the basic principles, underlined the time and space scale of its application and analysed its accuracy and suitability for use in arid and semi-arid environments. A specific section is dedicated to advection. Finally, the specific problems of each method for correct use in the Mediterranean region are underlined. In conclusion, we focus attention on the most interesting new guidelines for research on the measurement and estimation of actual crop evapotranspiration.},

	abstract = {The Bowen ratio-energy balance ({BREB}) is a micrometeorological method often used to estimate latent heat flux because of its simplicity, robustness, and cost. Estimates of latent heat flux have compared favorably with other methods in several studies, but other studies have been less certain, especially when there was sensible heat advection. We compared the latent heat flux of irrigated alfalfa (Medicago sativa, L.) estimated by the {BREB} method with that measured by lysimeters over a growing season in the semi-arid, advective environment of the southern High Plains. Difference statistics from the comparison and indicators of sensible heat advection were used to analyze the performance of the {BREB} method relative to lysimeters. Latent heat flux was calculated from mass change measured by two precision weighing lysimeters and from two {BREB} systems that used interchanging temperature and humidity sensors. Net radiation (Rn), soil heat flux (G), and other meteorological variables were also measured. Difference statistics included the root mean square difference ({RMSD}) and relative {RMSD} (normalized by mean lysimeter latent heat flux). Differences between lysimeters averaged 5–15\% during the day, and 25–45\% at night. Estimates of latent heat flux by the two {BREB} systems agreed closely (relative {RMSD}=8\%) when they were at the same location with sensors at the same height. Differences increased when the location was the same but sensors were at different heights, or when the sensor height was the same but location in the field different, and probably was related to limited fetch and the influence of different source areas beyond the field. Relative {RMSD} between lysimeter and {BREB} latent heat fluxes averaged by cutting was 25–29\% during the first two cuttings and decreased to 16–19\% during the last three cuttings. Relative {RMSD} between the methods varied from 17 to 28\% during morning hours with no pattern based on cutting. Afternoon relative {RMSD} was 25\% during the first two cuttings and decreased to 15\% during subsequent cuttings. Greatest differences between the two methods were measured when the Bowen ratios were less than 0, on days that were hot, dry and windy, or when the latent heat flux exceeded the available energy (Rn−G). These conditions were likely to be encountered throughout the growing season, but were more common earlier in the season.},
